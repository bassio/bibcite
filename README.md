# Bibcite plugin for Obsidian


## Bibcite

Bibcite is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to easily cite and refer to the literature stored in your Reference Manager Library (Zotero) during your note-taking. This integration enhances the use of Obsidian as a focused study and research tool.

## Requirements

- Zotero (version 6). (https://www.zotero.org/download/)
- Zotero's Better BibTeX plugin. (https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/index.html)
- Note: Zotero, with Better BibTeX installed, must be running while you are using this plugin.

## Use case

This plugin's would fit optimally within your research workflow, if you operate using the following assumptions:
- You use zotero as your main reference manager.
- You have a large zotero library with potentially many hundreds of pdf articles, and you use zotero for in-pdf annotations/highlights.
- You aim to write your own study and/or research notes / articles (e.g. a "Zettelkasten" or a "Second Brain" system, or alternatively exam study curriculum)
- You would have wished to keep your notes and study and/or research writings within Zotero as well for optimal integration, but unfortunately you find that you need a more powerful and flexible tool for your note-taking (i.e. Obsidian).
- You want to be able to, in your notes, to easily and quickly reference / cite the relevant literature.
- You want to be able to easily review or peek into your highlighted or annotated source references.
